# Improvements backlog

This is the task list the "manager" session works from. Add one entry per
improvement you want built. When an entry's status is `ready`, the manager
will claim a lane for it via `scripts/session.sh` and hand it to its own
agent session, working in an isolated worktree so it can never collide with
another lane's uncommitted edits.

## Adding entries

Two intake channels, both feed this same backlog:

- **At your computer:** run `node tools/improvements-server.js` (or ask the
  manager to launch it), open `http://localhost:5820`, fill in the form,
  click "Submit to IMPROVEMENTS.md" — it writes straight into this file.
- **On the go, no Claude sign-in needed:** open EBBLESS itself → Settings →
  About → "Suggest an improvement" (or go straight to
  [github.com/MalGriot/EBBLESS/issues/new?template=improvement-idea.yml&labels=idea](https://github.com/MalGriot/EBBLESS/issues/new?template=improvement-idea.yml&labels=idea)).
  Only needs a GitHub login — nothing Claude-specific. It files a GitHub
  issue labeled `idea`, not an entry in this file directly. The manager
  syncs those into the backlog below (`gh issue list --label idea --state
  open`), appends each as an entry here, and closes the issue with a
  comment linking to the entry it became — ask it to sync, or it checks at
  the start of a session. Only Title is required on either channel;
  everything else can be filled in later.

## How this works

1. You add/edit entries below (directly, or via one of the intake channels above). Anything you want built goes in `ready`.
2. The manager (this Claude Code session) picks up `ready` entries, up to
   the agreed parallelism limit (currently: **2-3 lanes at once**), and for
   each one:
   - runs `scripts/session.sh start <slug> "<scope>"` to create an isolated
     worktree + branch (`agent/<slug>`)
   - dispatches a subagent into that worktree with the entry's description
     as its brief
   - sets the entry's status to `in-progress`
3. Before any lane commits+pushes, the manager diffs it against every other
   active lane's current worktree contents. If two lanes touched overlapping
   regions of `index.html` in a way that would conflict, the manager holds
   the later one, sequences the merge, and re-runs the diff check rather
   than letting both push blind.
4. Lanes **commit and push to their own `agent/<slug>` branch only** —
   never to `main`, and nothing is ever deployed live by the manager. Status
   moves to `review`.
5. Once all in-flight lanes for a batch reach `review`, the manager posts
   you a report (what changed, per-lane diff summary, how to look at each
   branch locally) and stops.
6. You review locally. For whatever you approve, the manager gives you a
   final list of diffs to actually ship, and merges to `main` / deploys only
   on your explicit go-ahead.

Status values: `draft` (not ready yet) · `ready` (queue it) ·
`in-progress` · `review` (pushed, awaiting your local check) ·
`approved` (ok to merge to main) · `merged` · `dropped`.

## Backlog

<!--
Add entries in this shape:

### <short-slug>: <one-line title>
- **Status:** draft
- **Priority:** medium
- **Description:** what should change and why, concretely enough that an
  agent with no other context could implement it correctly.
- **Touches:** rough area of index.html / which feature, if known.
- **Branch:** (filled in by the manager once a lane is claimed)
- **Notes:** anything else — constraints, things to avoid, prior attempts.
